Hello, I'm Arjo Ghosh, and I'm truly passionate about all things tech. As a tech enthusiast, I'm constantly on the lookout for the latest innovations, trends, and emerging technologies that shape our digital world. I believe that technology has the power to transform our lives, and I'm excited to be a part of this ever-evolving landscape.

My journey in the tech world has been an exhilarating one. From early coding adventures to developing intricate software solutions, I've had the privilege of delving deep into the realm of programming. With proficiency in multiple programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, Java, and C++, I find joy in solving complex problems and creating elegant, efficient solutions.

Web development, both on the front-end and back-end, is a realm I've explored extensively. I've worked with HTML, CSS, and cutting-edge frameworks like React and Node.js to craft interactive and dynamic web applications.
Now I am presnting my chatbot.
The project aims to develop a user-friendly chatbot that closely resembles ChatGPT using the OpenAI GPT-3 API and a Gradio interface for easy interaction. This chatbot will be capable of holding natural language conversations with users, answering questions, and providing engaging responses.
Technology Stack:

Python: The core programming language.
OpenAI GPT-3 API: For generating responses.
Gradio: For creating the interactive web-based interface.
Flask (optional): For backend development if needed for more advanced features.
HTML/CSS (if needed): For customizing the user interface.
