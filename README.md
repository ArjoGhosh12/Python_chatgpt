# Python_chatgpt
The project aims to develop a user-friendly chatbot that closely resembles ChatGPT using the OpenAI GPT-3 API and a Gradio interface for easy interaction. This chatbot will be capable of holding natural language conversations with users, answering questions, and providing engaging responses.
Technology Stack:

Python: The core programming language.
OpenAI GPT-3 API: For generating responses.
Gradio: For creating the interactive web-based interface.
Flask (optional): For backend development if needed for more advanced features.
HTML/CSS (if needed): For customizing the user interface.
